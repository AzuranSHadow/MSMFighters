# MSMFighters

This is a PC Game Only. To download it, go to this link (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RU3TS3zS2ygU4MGeQKiyE-_uqPpblZaB/view?usp=sharing)

Then unzip the file into your desktop. Then open the Folder, open the msm fighters folder in that, and then the msm fighters beta 0.1 win64 bits folder.
In there look for msmfighters beta 0.1.exe.

Controls are A and D for left to right, W for jump, double W for Double Jump, and G and H for Punch and Kick. There's also a special attack- but you'll need to find that yourself ;)
